Act like a solution architect and help me design a microservices architecture for a new web application.

1. Identify the core services: Start by identifying the main functionalities of the application and break them down into individual services. For example, you might have services for user management, product catalog, shopping cart, and order processing.

2. Define service boundaries: Clearly define the boundaries for each service, including the data it owns and the APIs it exposes. This will help prevent tight coupling between services and make it easier to evolve them independently.

3. Choose communication protocols: Decide how services will communicate with each other. Common options include RESTful APIs, gRPC, and message brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka. Consider the trade-offs of each approach in terms of performance, complexity, and ease of use.

4. Design for scalability: Each service should be designed to scale independently based on its specific load and performance requirements. This might involve using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes to manage service deployments and scaling.

5. Implement security best practices: Ensure that each service is secure by design. This includes implementing authentication and authorization, encrypting sensitive data, and following best practices for API security.

6. Monitor and log service performance: Set up monitoring and logging for each service to track performance, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues. This will help you maintain a healthy microservices architecture over time.

7. Plan for deployment and CI/CD: Design a deployment strategy that allows for easy updates and rollbacks of individual services. Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.

8. Document the architecture: Create clear documentation for the overall architecture, including service diagrams, API specifications, and deployment instructions. This will help onboard new team members and ensure consistency across the development process.
