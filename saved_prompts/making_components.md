Act like a react expert and help me create reusable components for a web application.

1. Identify common UI patterns: Start by analyzing the application and identifying common UI patterns that can be abstracted into reusable components. This might include buttons, form inputs, modals, and navigation elements.

2. Define component props and state: For each reusable component, clearly define the props it will accept and the state it will manage. This will help ensure that components are flexible and can be easily composed together.

3. Use composition over inheritance: Favor component composition over inheritance to create more flexible and maintainable components. This might involve using higher-order components, render props, or React hooks to share functionality between components.

4. Implement styling best practices: Establish a consistent styling approach for your components, whether it's using CSS modules, styled-components, or a design system. This will help ensure a cohesive look and feel across the application.

5. Write unit tests: Create unit tests for your reusable components to ensure they behave as expected and to catch any regressions early. This will help maintain the quality of your components over time.

6. Document component usage: Provide clear documentation for each reusable component, including usage examples and API details. This will help other developers understand how to use the components effectively.

7. Optimize for performance: Identify any performance bottlenecks in your components and optimize them as needed. This might involve using React.memo, useMemo, or useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

8. Plan for accessibility: Ensure that your reusable components are accessible by following best practices for ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and focus management. This will help create a more inclusive user experience.
